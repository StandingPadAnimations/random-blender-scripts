# Random Blender Scripts

Just some random Blender scripts/addons I've made in the past that are too small to warrent their own repos

- `nuke_version.py` - An addon that, once enabled, will delete a Blender install's configuration
- `pack_ies_files.py` - An addon that adds a hook when saving that goes through all lights in the scene,
  imports external IES files as text datablocks, and sets IES nodes to those datablocks so that IES textures
  can be packed in a blend file like most other external assets
